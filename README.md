# Pressure Dependent Reactions implemented into ATMO

This repository contains the implementation of pressure dependent reactions into ATMO, as part of my MPhys Project and dissertation titled "The Effects of a New Chemical Scheme on the Composition and Spectra of Giant Exoplanetary Atmospheres". The dissertation can be found [here](https://drive.proton.me/urls/WGV57CDY64#SzUvXANpNrcv).

## Contribution

The file "PressureDependentReactions.py" contains the code contributions made for the MPhys project. Specifically, the contributions begin from line 739 and continue until line 776. Additionally, further contributions can be found in various other parts of the file.
